# W10 (Saturday 11/6): Advanced Utilization of Pronghorn

## Lead: Thomas White (Physics)

## 1-day workshop

This workshop will build on the principles developed in workshop W7. It will provide students with a solid understanding of the differences in the types/classes of parallel computing. We will cover multi-threading and multi-processing, shared and distributed memory, job scaling and profiling, and interactive jobs. All examples will utilize the Pronghorn High-Performance Computing (HPC) system. Pre-reqs: [Week 4 (Introduction to Linux)](<https://github.com/moni-roy/GRAD-778/tree/main/Linux Introduction>),[Week 8 (Introduction to Batch Processing in Pronghorn)](<https://github.com/moni-roy/GRAD-778/tree/main/Intro Pronghorn Module>).
