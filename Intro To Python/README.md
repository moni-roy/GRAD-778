# W7 (Saturday 10/16): Intro to Python

(Programming and Data Analytics in Python)

## Lead: Emily Hand

- Computer Science & Engineering

## 1-day short workshop

- 6 hours instructional

## Introduction

In this workshop, students will learn the fundamentals of the Python programming language, and then work on some applied sessions in different subject areas. Students will gain experience with Google Colab, which is excellent for quick prototyping. The target audience of this workshop is those with little to no prior experience with Python and is primarily intended to help students begin using Python on their own beyond the workshop. In the first half of the workshop, students will review and work with code provided by the instructors, including demonstrations and applied examples. In the second half of the workshop, students will work through activities that will provide them with hands-on experience in working with data, and conducting analysis in Python.
