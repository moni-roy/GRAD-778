## 1-day workshop

This workshop will introduce the fundamentals of high-performance and parallel computing. I will introduce basic parallel computing concepts while students learn how to access and utilize Pronghorn, the University's high-performance supercomputer. During class, you will obtain hands-on experience running parallelized calculations through the SLURM job submission system.
