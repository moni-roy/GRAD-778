# W2-3 (Saturday 9/11, 9/18 ): “Data Operations and Programming in R (Intro to R)”

## Lead: Kevin Shoemaker (NRES)

## 2-day short workshop: 14 hours instructional (in-person)

The statistical programming software ‘R’ is one of the fundamental tools for modern data science. This ‘bootcamp’ consists of a series of short sessions, each of which covers a particular skill (e.g., reading data, writing functions). Each session will consist of a short lecture, a demo (worked examples), followed by hands-on activities. The main goal of this workshop will be to ensure participants have enough proficiency and confidence with data operations and programming in R to engage in productive, self-directed learning and problem-solving. The first session will focus on R syntax, data management (loading data, writing to file), data summaries and visualizations, R packages (loading, getting help), and statistical operations. The second set of sessions will focus on some more advanced programming operations (loops, functions, debugging etc.), graphical visualizations and spatial analyses, and working with large data sets. All code will be available as scripts that you can download from this website (at the top of each module page on this website) and load up in RStudio. That way you won’t need to constantly copy and paste from the web!
